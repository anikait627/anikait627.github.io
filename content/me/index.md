hey there 👋

my name is anikait! i’m a recent graduate from texas a&m university where i studied computer science and applied mathematics.

i'm passionate about solving complex problems with real world applications. 
my interests primarily lie in ai/ml, consumer products, and startups. 

previously i worked on viva pulse at *[glint](https://community.glintinc.com/)*, recommendation systems at *[nepris inc.](https://nepris.com)*, and market intelligence at *[bungee tech](http://bungeetech.com)*.

outside of work, you'll likely find me scaling rocks, smashing tennis balls, exploring culinary recipes, or hopping between concerts with friends. 🧗🏾🎾👨🏾‍🍳🐙

happy to [connect](mailto:anikaitsharma@yahoo.com) over a cup of coffee! ☕️
